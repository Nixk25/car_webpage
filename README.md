<h1>Rentopia: Car Rental Web Application 🚗</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Rentopia is a web application designed for car rental services. Although the rental functionality is not fully implemented, the platform allows users to search for cars using a combobox and displays detailed information about each car. Additionally, the application integrates with APIs to showcase car images from various angles. Rentopia primarily focuses on the frontend, utilizing Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Headless UI for components.
